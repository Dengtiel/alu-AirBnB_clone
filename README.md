# ALU AirBnB Clone - The Console

This project is the first step in building a full web application that simulates the functionalities of the AirBnB platform. It is developed as part of the ALU software engineering curriculum, aiming to deepen understanding of object-oriented programming, data persistence, and the creation of a command-line interface (CLI) using Python.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a command interpreter that will manage AirBnB objects in a simple and powerful way. This interpreter allows users to create, view, update, and delete instances of various classes, including `BaseModel`, `User`, `Place`, `City`, `Amenity`, `State`, and `Review`.

The backend architecture is built using Python classes and stores data in a JSON file for persistent storage. Future modules will add more features like database storage, RESTful API, and a dynamic front end.

## ðŸ’» The Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is the core interface used to interact with the backend of the application. It works in both interactive and non-interactive modes.

### ðŸ”ƒ How to Start It

Make sure you are in the root directory of the repository and that Python 3 is installed on your system.

```bash
$ ./console.py
````

This will launch the interpreter in interactive mode.

To run in non-interactive mode (e.g., from a script or for testing):

```bash
$ echo "create BaseModel" | ./console.py
```

### ðŸ›  Available Commands

* `create <class_name>` â€“ Creates a new instance of a class and saves it to the JSON file.
* `show <class_name> <id>` â€“ Displays the string representation of an instance.
* `destroy <class_name> <id>` â€“ Deletes an instance based on the class name and ID.
* `all [class_name]` â€“ Displays all instances, or all instances of a given class.
* `update <class_name> <id> <attribute_name> <attribute_value>` â€“ Updates an attribute of an instance.

### âœ… Examples

```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create BaseModel
fa3f-1a5b-9d34-41e3-912f

(hbnb) show BaseModel fa3f-1a5b-9d34-41e3-912f
[BaseModel] (fa3f-1a5b-9d34-41e3-912f) {'id': '...', 'created_at': '...', 'updated_at': '...'}

(hbnb) all
["[BaseModel] (...) {...}", "[User] (...) {...}"]

(hbnb) destroy BaseModel fa3f-1a5b-9d34-41e3-912f
(hbnb) quit
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

We use Python's built-in `unittest` framework to ensure each module and class functions as expected.

```bash
$ python3 -m unittest discover tests
```
